# datacleaningSQL


	Project Objectives:

		- Review and learn SQL concepts.
		- Learn more about Microsoft SQL Studio.
		- Expand the portfolio.
		- Clean and normalize tables using only SQL
			-> I always used to create python scripts using regular expressions (or use notepad++ if was too simple) to normalize and/or remove useless data/characters
		- Upload the project to GitHub.

		- I added the information to Tableau Public for visualization, with country, state, city, despite the good idea it ended up being too little data to show, so I decided to leave it as it.
  			-> the country was US, state TN, and city had around 14 different names, which resulted in a very small geographic chart, even zooming in. It worked but not enough to stay.
